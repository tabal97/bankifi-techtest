# POKEDEX: The Ultimate Pokemon Guide!

## WHAT IS IT?

Pokedex is a fun to use app that allows the user to browse through all the known pokemon and find out more about their stats and their abilities. The user can both search specifically for each pokemon using the pokemon finder tool; or if they are unsure or would like to explore pokemon based on their type then this app makes this possible.

The making of this app would not have been possible if it were not for the support of the open API that PokeAPI.co provides.

The app is responsive on both ios and andriod; all rights to the images and backgrounds used in this app are reserved for their publishers. This app is solely for demonstration purposes.

## Running the App:

To run this app you will need to begin by cloning this repo onto your machine.

As you will notice, the node-modules are missing; so you will need to use the command ``` npm install``` in the CLI to install the required modules.

Once this is done, you may proceed by running the command, ``` npm start ```; this will run a local server for the app using the native compiler that comes with React Native called "Expo".

To access the app on your device you will need to install the "Expo Client" on either your iOS or Android device, and then scan the QR code found on the CLI. (As you are accessing the app from the local server, you will need to connect your phone device to the same network your machine)

After a short minute or so, the app will appear and be accessible for use.

## Softwares:

- Node.js (Back-end framework)
- Axios (API requests)
- React Native (Front-end framework)
- Expo (Deployment)
- JEST (Testing)
- Eslint (Linting on pre-commits)
